# FIRST-ECOMMERCE-PROJECT

In this repository you can find the basics of an Ecommerce Website, in this case, working with Bluerays as a product. The whole web is done with react and material UI in the frontend, and node JS in the backend.

To start you only need to download the repository, make npm install for the dependencies in the main branch of the project and in the folder of the backend as well. Then you have to init the backend with npm start and run the frontend with npm run dev.

This will be enough to run the web site!
